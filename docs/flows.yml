    CumulusCI's suite of standard flows are grouped into various categories depending on their intended purpose.

groups:
    Org Setup:
        description: |
            These are the primary flows for doing full setup of an org.
            They typically include a flow from the Dependency Management group,
            a flow from either the Deployment or Install / Uninstall group,
            and a flow from the Post-Install Configuration group.
    Dependency Management:
        description: |
            These flows deploy dependencies (base packages and unmanaged metadata) to a target org environment.
    Deployment:
        description: |
            These flows deploy the main package metadata to a target org environment.
    Install / Uninstall:
        description: |
            These flows handle package installation and uninstallation in particular scenarios.
    Post-Install Configuration:
        description: |
            These flows perform configuration after the main package has been installed or deployed.
    Continuous Integration:
        description: |
            These flows are designed to be run automatically by a continuous integration (CI) system
            in response to new commits. They typically set up an org and run Apex tests.
    Release Operations:
        description: |
            These flows are used to release new package versions.
    Other:
        description: |
            This is a catch-all group for any flows without a designated "group" attribute in ``cumulusci.yml``.
